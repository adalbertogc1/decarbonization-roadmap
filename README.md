# üå± Decarbonization Roadmap Tool

This is a basic but powerful Decarbonization Roadmap Tool. The goal is to predict carbon reductions using a bottom-up approach, taking uncertainties into account using Monte Carlo simulation. üöÄ This methodology leverages information about energy end-use breakdowns and primary energy sources.

![End uses](docs/end_uses.png)
The tool allows you to provide two classes of uncertainty:

- In estimating the current **end use**, which can be reduced with an energy audit.
- In predicting the **impact on energy reduction**, which comes from the modelling tool.

The blue area is the sum of the two uncertainties, which allows the user to understand how comfortable they are with their current uncertainty.

## Inputs üìä

The `decarbonization_info.json` file requires the following information:

### Current StateüèôÔ∏è

Allows to describe current energy use and carbon emissions:

- **Year (current)**: The current year for which the energy usage data is provided.

- **End Uses**:

  - **Heating**: Energy consumed for space heating in a building.
  - **Cooling**: Energy consumed for space cooling, including air conditioning.
  - **Interior Lighting**: Energy used to illuminate a building's interior spaces, encompassing general and task lighting.
  - **Exterior Lighting**: Energy used to illuminate exterior areas such as parking lots, walkways, and building facades.
  - **Ventilation**: Energy provides outdoor air ventilation to maintain indoor air quality and occupant comfort.
  - **Water Heating**: Energy used to heat water for various purposes, including domestic hot water, process water, and space heating through hydronic systems.
  - **Refrigeration**: Energy used for refrigeration systems, encompassing walk-in coolers, refrigerated display cases, and other commercial refrigeration equipment.
  - **Cooking**: Energy used for cooking appliances in commercial kitchens, such as ovens, stoves, grills, fryers, and other cooking equipment.
  - **Plug Loads**: Energy used by miscellaneous electrical equipment, such as computers, printers, copiers, kitchen appliances, and other plug-in devices.
  - **Process Loads**: Energy used for specific processes or equipment within a building, such as industrial machinery, manufacturing processes, or specialized equipment.

  For each end-use, provide the following:

  - **EUI (kWh/m2/year)**: The energy use intensity or consumption per unit area.
  - **Uncertainty**: The uncertainty associated with the EUI measurement is the standard deviation.
  - **Primary Energy**: The primary energy source to fulfil the energy demand for the end-use. Options are: `electricity`, `natural_gas`, `liquefied_gas`, `diesel` or `solar_pv`.

### Decarbonization improvements üîÆ

Allows to describe decarbonization efforts scheduled in the future:

- **Year (future)**: The year for decarbonization improvements is scheduled.

- **Description**: A brief description of the intervention planned.

- **End Uses Reduction (kWh/m2/year)**: The energy use change in energy consumption for each end-use. Negative values indicate a reduction, while positive values indicate an increase. The value of this key is assumed to be `0.0` if not provided. 
- **End Uses Uncertainty (kWh/m2/year)**: The uncertainty associated with the projected energy reductions for each end-use is represented as the standard deviation.  This key is ignored if the End Uses Reduction is `0.0`.
- **End Uses Primary Energy**: The primary energy source projected for each end-use in the future year(s). This key is ignored if the End Uses Reduction is `0.0`.

Make sure to fill these details accurately in `decarbonization_info.json` for reliable projections and simulations.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Installation**:

   - Install Python modules required by the script:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Execution**:

   - Run the script:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Optional Customization**:
   - Edit the `decarbonization_info.json` file to provide custom information like end-uses, primary energy sources, carbon emission factors, and predictions for end-use changes.
